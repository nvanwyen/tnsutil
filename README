TNS2LDIF is a set of command line utilities for managing TNS entry data locally
and through LDAP
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Background
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These utilities are based on the idea from Mark J Bobak tns2ldif.c
(see http://markjbobak.wordpress.com/2013/10/11/openldap-care-and-feeding-of-you
r-ldap-server for more information), but is a complete rewrite (not using
anything from Bobak, except the idea behind the need).



Utilities
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

tns2ldif - convert a tnsnames.ora file to an LDIF file that can be loaded
           into an LDAP store

ldif2tns - convert an LDIF file (output from ldapsearch -L) into a tnsnames.ora
           file

tns2ldap - load a tnsnames.ora file into an LDAP store which is compliant with
           Oracle's EUS repository requirements

ldap2tns - create a tnsnames.ora from a Oracle EUS compliant repository, which
           can be used locally
